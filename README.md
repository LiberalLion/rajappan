<b>What is Security?</b>

In simple words it is about protection. Earlier, we had physical security to protect our valuable assets in the physical world. But when we move more toward the cyber world, we need a new set of software and tools to protect our data and privacy.
The three pillars of security are:

### CIA triad

<b>Confidentiality</b> — this focuses on protecting the “Read” operation. You do not want unauthorized people to read your confidential information, for example, your credit card number, your passwords, or payroll amount.

<b>Integrity</b> — this focuses on protecting the “Write” operation. You do not want unauthorized people to modify your data. For example, you do not want someone to withdraw money from your bank account without your permission.

<b>Availability</b> — this means the systems and data are always accessible when you need them. For example, an online banking system or an online shopping site should always be on.
